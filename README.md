# Cursor Branding Guide
Cursor is a youth organisation in the GTA striving to teach code and design to passionate teens. To promote a strong brand, we need a concrete guide, to ensure no mistaking our brand with anyone else in the area or online.

### Colour

For the logo, we use a mix of 3 colours, found in the Russian poster art swatch in Adobe Illustrator.

#### For Print Media
- Colour 1 (purple): C=81.47% M=83.61% Y=:39.09% K=:32.4%
- Colour 2 (red): C=22.64% M=92.41% Y=49.1% K=5.08%
- Colour 3 (pink): C=21.2% M=44.14% Y=16.09% K=0%

#### To make the logo, we
1. used a gradient with colours 1 and 2 with a starting point of 13.39% on colour 1
2. then a second fill is applied to the logo with colour 3 at an opacity of 25%
3. the original fill is then set to an opacity of 75%
4. finally, an extra, third, white fill is added to nullify the previous opacity levels

The inner region to the right of the left wing has an additional 10% black fill

### Shape

Split the above graphic along the tail of the cursor and rotate the second triangle out by 20 degrees from the nose to create the paper airplane.

### Assets

The paper plane should be used in all static images or UI. If animating the logo, the paper plane should fold in to become the attached cursor. The slide lengths of the triangle coming out of the bottom of the space between the wings should match the length of the cursor's original tail.

You can also find the logo in various sizes in this repo. The logos do not have a background but that version will be coming soon.
